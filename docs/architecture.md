# Architecture

How MiniSwerve's code fits together. Status marks: **built**, **next**, **planned**.

## Threads

| Thread | Rate | Owns | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main | 100 Hz, RT priority 1 | settings, logging, wanted states, commands | built |
| Swerve | 250 Hz, RT | module control, odometry samples, vision ingest | next |
| Settings writer | on demand | saving Robot Settings to disk | built |

The swerve thread never logs. It writes samples into preallocated ring buffers; the main loop
drains them into logged inputs, and replay feeds the same inputs back.

## Main loop order

1. `RobotLoop.next()`
2. `RobotSettings.periodic()`: live tuning (disabled, off-field only), values logged as inputs
3. Subsystem inputs (drain swerve samples, cameras)
4. Pose: TagEKF (drives the robot) + WPILib estimator (shadow) + plain odometry (shadow)
5. Wanted-state machines and commands
6. Alerts, telemetry

## Packages

```
frc.robot                 this robot only
  Robot, Main, RunMode, LoggingSetup
  config/                 Hardware (CAN IDs, ratios: hard stops)
  subsystems/<name>/      one folder per subsystem              (next)
  pilot/                  driver controller bindings            (next)
frc.spectrumLib           reusable; moves to its own repo later
  framework/              SpectrumRobot, RobotLoop
  robotsettings/          Robot Settings (layered JSON, live tuning, saving)
  telemetry/              Telemetry facade, Alert, DashboardReceiver
  swerve/                 custom swerve on Phoenix 6 Pro          (next)
  localization/           TagEKF, odometry guard                  (planned)
  vision/                 our camera frame structs + reader       (planned)
  statemachine/           wanted-state base                       (planned)
```

## Robot Settings

Values tuned on the robot that survive deploys. Declared in code, resolved from layers (later
wins): code default, `deploy/settings/<group>.json`, `deploy/settings/robots/<robot>/<group>.json`,
the robot-local folder `/home/systemcore/settings/<robot>/`, then live NT edits at
`/RobotSettings/...`. Every value and its layer is a logged input.

Planned: boot reconciliation with three rules plus a git-ancestry check, and Gradle tasks to fetch
the robot's saved values and apply them to git (see the 2026-FM-SystemCore Robot App brief).

## Replay

Strict from day one: anything that changes behavior is a logged input, calibration included.
Logs carry the git SHA, branch and dirty flag.

## Vision

Our PhotonVision fork will publish a compact, versioned per-camera struct (frame header + per-tag
bearing, range, corners, margin) instead of PhotonLib's results. The struct definitions live in
`frc.spectrumLib.vision` and are shared with the fork. Sim produces the same structs.

## Autos and modes

Auto selection and test mode use WPILib 2027 OpModes. Autos ask subsystems for wanted states; the
auto builder (Choreo-based paths, straight-line paths) comes later.
